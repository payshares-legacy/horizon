# 
# A TotalOrderId expressed the total order of Ledgers, Transactions and 
# Operations.  
# 
# Operations within the payshares network have a total order, expressed by three
# pieces of information:  the ledger sequence the operation was validated in,
# the order which the operation's containing transaction was applied in 
# that ledger, and the index of the operation within that parent transaction.
# 
# We express this order by packing those three pieces of information into a
# single signed 64-bit number (we used a signed number for SQL compatibility).
# 
# The follow diagram shows this format:
# 
#    0                   1                   2                   3        
#    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

# By component:
# 
# Ledger Sequence: 32-bits
# 
#   A complete ledger sequence number in which the operation was validated.
# 
#   Expressed in network byte order.
# 
# Transaction Application Order: 20-bits
# 
#   The order that the transaction was applied within the ledger it was 
#   validated.  Accommodates up to 1,048,575 transactions in a single ledger.
# 
#   Expressed in network byte order.
# 
# Operation Index: 10-bits
# 
#   The index of the operation within its parent transaction. Accommodates up 
#   to 4095 operations per transaction.
# 
#   Expressed in network byte order.

# Note: API Clients should not be interpreting this value.  We will use it
# as an opaque paging token that clients can parrot back to us after having read
# it within a resource to page from the represented position in time.  
# 
# Note: This does not uniquely identify an object.  Given a ledger, it will 
# share its id with its first transaction and the first operation of that 
# transaction as well.  Given that this ID is only meant for ordering within a
# single type of object, the sharing of ids across object types seems 
# acceptable.
